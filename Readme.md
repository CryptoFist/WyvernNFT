3. And any ERC-20 implementation token
4. Deploy the smart contracts mentioned in points 1-3 on one of the testnets of your choice (Ropsten, Rinkeby, Mumbai etc)

b) Users can list their NFT token for sale for any price they want using ERC-20 token from point 3. The sell orders have to be stored off-chain. You can use any persistent storage mechanism you like.
